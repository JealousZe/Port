A little more about myself â€” outside of my professional life, I enjoy going to the gym because I love physically challenging myself and pushing my limits. Another reason I train is to stay fit, as I have a strong desire to compete in martial arts. Whether it's boxing or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I aspire to test my abilities in competition. If I get the opportunity to compete, I plan to explore and learn as many martial arts as I can.

I also have a passion for reading, especially manga. This interest started when I was about 10 years old, after I stumbled upon channel 627 on Sky TV and discovered Dragon Ball Z, a Japanese anime series based on a manga. The storytelling, character development, and action-packed scenes captivated me, and Dragon Ball Z became a huge influence on my life. Since then, manga has been a significant part of my interests, and I continue to explore different series and genres within it.
