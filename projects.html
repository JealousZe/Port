      <h2>Learning How to Code (2023-2024)</h2>
      <p>My Starting Point was When I began learning to code, I started with basic functions to build a strong foundation. Some of my first projects included simple tasks like creating a drop filter and an alphabetical filter. 

Drop Filter: I wrote a function that could remove unwanted or unnecessary elements from a list based on certain conditions. This helped me understand concepts like loops, conditionals, and list manipulation. 

Alphabetic Filter: I developed a function to sort or filter data alphabetically, which introduced me to string handling, sorting algorithms, and comparison operations. 

Through these beginner projects, I became more comfortable with the logic behind coding, problem-solving, and writing clean, functional code. Each small project gave me the confidence to explore more advanced topics over time.

      <p>This project started as a personal challenge to test my growing skills in HTML and CSS. Having become more comfortable with the basics, I wanted to step outside my comfort zone and experiment with more advanced layouts, responsive design, and styling techniques. The goal was to apply what I had learned so far, while also exploring new concepts, best practices, and creative design solutions. Through this process, I was able to deepen my understanding of front-end development and strengthen my problem-solving abilities.</p>

  <h2>Learning JavaScript (May–June 2025)</h2>
      <p>"I have initiated my learning by focusing on Java for backend development in the YHWH project, where I am building core server-side functionality. Simultaneously, I am expanding my skill set by developing frontend features, including a responsive sidebar navigation, dynamic sliders, and automated slideshows to create a more engaging and user-friendly interface.</p>

      <p>Manga Popup Shop is a Crunchyroll-inspired web project with a unique focus on manga content. In this project, I applied my JavaScript skills to create dynamic and interactive features, including an automatic slideshow, a content slider, and other engaging UI elements. This project allowed me to practice and refine my frontend development abilities, particularly in DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interface design.</p>

      <h2>Addesti (summer 2025)</h2>
      <p>As I continue learning and expanding my skill set, I believe it's essential to consistently build projects that allow me to apply and refine what I've learned. Addesti is a high-end fashion e-commerce concept inspired by luxury brands. For this website, I plan to implement a range of animations — from bold, attention-grabbing visuals inspired by brands like Gucci, to elegant, subtle transitions reminiscent of Dior. My goal for Addesti is not just to create a fully functional website, but to build a true showcase of my technical abilities, design sensibilities, and creativity in web development.</p>

      <h2>YHWH-YourHolyWayHeals app(Autumn 2025-late 2025)</h2>
      <p>Since the YHWH App will be my first major project, my primary focus is on building a fully functional, user-friendly application that runs smoothly and reliably. Unlike my Addesti project, where I plan to explore more advanced animations and visual effects, my goal for YHWH is to prioritize solid functionality, clean design, and a seamless user experience, ensuring the core features work efficiently and intuitively.</p>
