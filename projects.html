      <h2>Built  a Personal Computer(2022)</h2>
      <p>My PC Building Journey: From Research to Troubleshooting and Upgrades

I started by building my own gaming PC, aiming for high efficiency and high FPS performance. To achieve this, I conducted extensive research using platforms like YouTube, Reddit, online forums, and PC building communities.</p>

      <h2>Learning How to Code(2023-2024)</h2>
      <p>My Starting Point was When I began learning to code, I started with basic functions to build a strong foundation. Some of my first projects included simple tasks like creating a drop filter and an alphabetical filter. 

Drop Filter: I wrote a function that could remove unwanted or unnecessary elements from a list based on certain conditions. This helped me understand concepts like loops, conditionals, and list manipulation. 

Alphabetic Filter: I developed a function to sort or filter data alphabetically, which introduced me to string handling, sorting algorithms, and comparison operations. 

Through these beginner projects, I became more comfortable with the logic behind coding, problem-solving, and writing clean, functional code. Each small project gave me the confidence to explore more advanced topics over time.
