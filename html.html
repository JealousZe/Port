      <h2>Learning How to Code (2023-2024)</h2>
      <p>My Starting Point was When I began learning to code, I started with basic functions to build a strong foundation. Some of my first projects included simple tasks like creating a drop filter and an alphabetical filter. 

Drop Filter: I wrote a function that could remove unwanted or unnecessary elements from a list based on certain conditions. This helped me understand concepts like loops, conditionals, and list manipulation. 

Alphabetic Filter: I developed a function to sort or filter data alphabetically, which introduced me to string handling, sorting algorithms, and comparison operations. 

Through these beginner projects, I became more comfortable with the logic behind coding, problem-solving, and writing clean, functional code. Each small project gave me the confidence to explore more advanced topics over time.

          <p>This project started as a personal challenge to test my growing skills in HTML and CSS. Having become more comfortable with the basics, I wanted to step outside my comfort zone and experiment with more advanced layouts, responsive design, and styling techniques. The goal was to apply what I had learned so far, while also exploring new concepts, best practices, and creative design solutions. Through this process, I was able to deepen my understanding of front-end development and strengthen my problem-solving abilities.</p>
